Mean method: add if statement to handle empty Arrays

min/max method: added input validation 

lowest/highest method: method implemented but fails one grading test particulary when k is over the range 

Missing data: I already did the methods, but you mentioned that you didn't see where the methods are happening,
but to let you know if you have missed something. For the missing data methods, I did isEqualTo, logicalNot, and mean2 which could filter
the dataset.
